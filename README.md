# Differential Equations Projects

This repository contains my work in differential equations, showcasing various mathematical concepts and their implementations using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

- **Directional Fields**: Visualization and analysis of directional fields in differential equations
- **Jacobian Matrices**: Implementation and analysis of Jacobian matrices for systems of differential equations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Required Python packages (can be installed via pip):
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy jupyter
   ```

## About the Projects

### Directional Fields
This notebook demonstrates the visualization of directional fields for differential equations, helping to understand the behavior of solutions without explicitly solving them.

### Jacobian Matrices
This project explores the use of Jacobian matrices in analyzing systems of differential equations, including stability analysis and phase plane visualization.
